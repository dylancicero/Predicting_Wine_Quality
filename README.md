# Predicting Wine Quality
Here, I explore a dataset on wine characteristics and quality for 1599 samples of wine from the north of Portugal.
This exersize was completed for a Data Analysis course, Spring 2019, and showcases linear model variable selection methods,
Ridge/Lasso regressions, and discussion of (misleading) significance probabilities.

Included, find the R script and R markdown .pdf output.
